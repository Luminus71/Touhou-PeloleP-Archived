# Touhou-PeloleP-Archived
A big project that was being worked by me that was canceled by Blusagi370 on Discord, project will be back in 6 years estimated.

When you download this Prototype, make sure to rename the following folders:

"Imagenes" ---> "images"

"Imagenes/stagess" ---> "images/stages"

Renaming this to their orignal names (images and images/stages) will make the mod to work correctly.

Psych required: 0.6.0, 0.6.1, 0.6.2, 0.6.3 and above (0.5.X)

Final note: This prototype is still unfinished, so please keep that in mind.
